# c. Write down the observations on Input and Output.
 #Observations:
     #1. Input:
              #Any obstacle that comes in the range of the sensor is detected.IR sensors actually
              #measure the heat being emitted from the object. So the heat is the actual input for
              #sensors. The IR sensor gets its input from GPIO 21.
     #2. Output:
              #The output is shown by the LED's and the buzzer.When an obstacle is detected, the Green
              #LED glows and buzzer is turned on, i.e whenever heat is sensed by the sensor, output is shown.
              #The output is shown by making the GPIO 15(Green LED) and GPIO 18(Buzzer) HIGH.


# d. Write down the Result and Conclusion.
